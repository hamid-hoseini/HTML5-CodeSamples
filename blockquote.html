<p>According to the Quackit website:
<blockquote>Browsers generally render blockquote text as indented text.
    If your quoted text needs to display within a non-quoted paragraph,
    you should use the <a href="/html_5/tags/html_q_tag.cfm" target="_blank">HTML q tag</a>.
    Most browsers surround q text with quotation marks.
